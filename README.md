A comprehensive, scalable, event-driven platform that collects, processes, and analyzes health and wellness data from various sources, providing personalized insights and interactive features through a modern web dashboard.

## 🎯 Project Overview

VitalFlow demonstrates modern cloud-native development practices with a microservices architecture built using multiple programming languages and technologies. The platform showcases real-time data processing, event-driven design, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

### Key Features
- 🔄 **Real-time Data Processing** with Apache Kafka
- 🏗️ **Microservices Architecture** with Go, Python, and Java
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** with React and Ant Design
- 📈 **Comprehensive Monitoring** with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger
- 🐳 **Containerized Deployment** with Docker and Kubernetes
- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Design** ready for Azure deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Event-Driven Microservices Architecture
- **Apache Kafka**: Central event streaming platform for real-time data processing
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled services for specific domains
- **Cloud-Native**: Deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Multi-Language**: Go, Python, and Java Spring Boot

### Core Services

#### Data Ingestion Layer
- **Ingestion Service** (Go): High-throughput data collection from health devices and APIs
- **Data Simulator** (Python): Simulates health data streams for testing

#### Processing Layer
- **Data Processing Service** (Java/Kafka Streams): Real-time data transformations and aggregations
- **Analytics Service** (Python): ML-powered insights and predictions

#### Business Logic Layer
- **User Profile Service** (Java): User management and health goals
- **Notification Service** (Java/Python): Real-time alerts and notifications
- **API Gateway** (Go): Unified REST API with authentication and rate limiting

#### AI/ML Layer
- **Chatbot Service** (Python): Conversational AI for health queries
- **Insights Engine** (Python): Personalized health recommendations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For running infrastructure services
- **Go 1.21+**: For the ingestion service
- **Python 3.11+**: For the data simulator
- **Node.js 18+**: For the React frontend
- **Java 17+**: For Spring Boot services (optional for initial setup)
- **Git**: For version control

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Health-and-Wellness

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d kafka zookeeper redis postgres prometheus grafana jaeger

# Set up development environment
make dev-setup

# Build all services
make build-all

# Start microservices
make start-services

# Access the dashboard
open http://localhost:3000
```
